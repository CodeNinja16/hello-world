###############################

This project requires the "lib" folder to be intact.

It also requires the following Python standard libraries:

1. OS
2. sys
3. time

It requires no external packages.


The program can be built with Makefile.py in this directory. It will be built to a PyC file for use on your system, with
your python installation.

You may need to rebuild for other platforms/installs, specifically different Python versions (especially older ones) and
CPU architechtures.
