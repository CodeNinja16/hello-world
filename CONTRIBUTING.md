# How to contribute to this pointless project

Despite the useless and test-ridden nature of this code, feel free to contribute.

### Things to keep in mind

1. **This is a test project!** This code is not in production, or use anywhere, *and never will be*. The only reason it
     exists is to test git and my network connection (sometimes)
     
1. **I don't maintain this project well** I set this up and forgot about it. Don't get offended if I seem to ignore your
     issue/PR
     
1. **Changing the nature of the project is disallowed** I don't want a fork to contain some JSON parser or web browser.
     Keep it to a test, and I'll be happy.
     
### How to get involved

1. Don't get involved.

2. If you're annoying, submit an issue. Else, submit a PR and I can inspect and merge it.

3. If there's a problem with the configuration of the repository, feel free to out an issue about that too.
