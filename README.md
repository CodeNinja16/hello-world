# hello-world, a test project
A test repository for my own use. This was my first ever public repository, and it is really terrible.

I just use this to publish testing code and experiments I've conducted. I usually just use it to test features of git/GitHub.

## Contribute

This repository is a test. This code does nothing. You don't need to contribute.

I mean, feel free if you really want to though.


### Bugs

If you seriously found a bug in the tiny abount of code in this program, you can submit an issue. I can't guaruntee I'll see it, though.

### Pull requests

Please **do not** submit pull requests, as they will likely end up being ignored. Sorry about that :(

The pull requests that are either open or closed were submitted by me as a test.

### Issue Tracking

I don't track issues for this repository, however, feel free to submit them.

## Why is this a thing?

Because I felt like making something using git. And who doesn't love git?

**Important information:** *This program is Python 3, not 2. It won't work on mac.*
